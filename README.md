OpenAI Crypto
This is a project that utilizes the OpenAI API to create a language model capable of generating text related to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.

How It Works
Obtaining OpenAI API Keys: To use this project, you will need to obtain your own OpenAI API keys. Follow the instructions in the official OpenAI documentation to create an account and obtain the necessary keys.

Installing Dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Clone this repository and install the dependencies by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setting Up API Keys: Open the .env file and replace the OPENAI_API_KEY field with your own API key value.

Running the Project: Once you have set up the API keys, you can run the project using the following command:

css
Copy code
python main.py
Interacting with the Model: Upon running the project, you can interact with the language model through an interactive command prompt. Simply enter text related to cryptocurrencies or blockchain, and the model will generate a corresponding response.
